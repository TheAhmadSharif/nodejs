At first make it on from the following link

Allow less secure apps: ON
By default it is Off


Secondly, Allow access for "Display Unlock captch option" (Allow access to your Google account). Here is the link : https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha


Step 2:


Check your smtp port is working by the following command

telnet localhost 25

If it is working then the result would be like this
